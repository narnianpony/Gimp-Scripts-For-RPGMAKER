## How to install GIMP scripts: 
(remember to unzip the file first)
https://docs.gimp.org/en/install-script-fu.html

## Features:
Auto select grid size: It is hard to remember the size of the tiles on each different image map, so the plugin changes the grid size to the specified one. Right now it supports:
fixed sizes: Faces, Icons, Tilesets
and dynamic sizes: file of 1 character and file of 8 characters.

I'm not using other image maps, but it is easy to add other sizes and formats

Character mirroring:
Working on small changes on a character then means you need to copy paste each different change on their mirrored counterparts for frames and directions, this script automatises cleaning and copy/past of those frames
Important: For this script you need to click on the canvas once to see the results
